Originally an old MSc project, created with the motivation to have a cross-platform library for directly embedding simple performance instrumentation (monitoring) code during development to allow specific areas of code to be isolated and analyzed.

Also contains a feasibility code section that outlines the thinking and tests carried out prior and during development, acts as a short logical story that records the thinking and thought process at the time.
