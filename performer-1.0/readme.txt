This framework main target platform is Linux with majority of development and tests conducted under Linux (Ubuntu) but the framework also supports and runs under Windows.

NOTE: The recommended platform to run is under Linux, with pre-built libraries with GCC 4.3.3 already provided so please run under Linux if possible.

The library requires the use of two external libraries, the boost-regex and xerces-c, the library already provides these under the /extLibs folder and simply need to added to the environment variables for you linker. Though it is recommended that you have your own version installed.

For building the library from source you must have both external libraries installed as the header files are needed.
